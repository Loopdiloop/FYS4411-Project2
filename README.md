#### FYS4411 - Computational Physics II: Quantum Mechanical Systems 
##### Project 1: Variational Monte Carlo Methods for Bosonic Systems

A Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approach has been developed to determine ground state energies of confined Bose systems with different numbers of particles and dimensions. Brute-force and importance sampling have been implemented. A non-interacting as well as an interacting system have been examined. Optimization of variational parameters has been done using the gradient descent method. The results have been evaluated using the statistical method of blocking. The one-body densities of particles have been determined and analyzed
